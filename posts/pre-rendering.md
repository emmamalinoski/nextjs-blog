The littlest most **confused** computer scientist entered the world in Charleston, WV on this fine day.  She did not even know what a computer was then.

**Little did she know** eighteen years later she would use many many computers, most of which to make art which makes lot of sense.

The **one thing** she never saw coming - telling the computer what to do with words.  It is very confusing.  And if you're reading his **that means she figured it out**.  If you're not, it's because she never got it to deploy from GitHub after doing stuff for **three hours** trying to get it to work.  Is it a tradgedy or a triumph?

*Probably both*
